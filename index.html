          <p>Thaw America is an effort to overturn an erroneous ruling by the secret FISA Court of Review which would massively and negatively impact American civil rights.  On November 21, 2016 Walsh and Walsh LLP filed a writ of certiorari with the US Supreme Court, requesting review of the ruling.  The ruling, named FISCR 16-01, allows law enforcement to record telephone calls and (potentially) internet traffic without a warrant.  The case centers on pen registers, a legal tool law enforcement uses to collect telephone metadata and which courts cannot refuse to grant.</p>

          <p>In FISCR 16-01, the FISA Court of Review (abbreviated FISCR or FICoR) found a pen register can be used to record the body of calls in order to collect any phone numbers dialed during the call.  This conflicts with the findings of every federal circuit court when considering the same question.  The other courts have found that recording the body of calls is illegal.</p>

          <p>The potential effects of FISCR 16-01 are widespread.  The largest effect is the removal to the right of privacy in phone calls.  Under this ruling, the government can, without a warrant or any significant judicial oversight, record the content of telephone calls.  Such recording can affect the right to free speech via a "chilling effect".  The chilling effect occurs when people know the government could be listening and choose not to express views the government (or its agents) may not like.</p>

          <p>Worse, FISCR 16-01 applies within the US, to US Citizens and permanent residents.  Pen registers are not just tools for foreign surveillance; they are quite commonly used in domestic investigations as well.</p>

          <h1>Background</h1>

          <p>In the phone system, dialing is done via a signaling mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling">DTMF &ndash; Dual Tone Multi-Frequency dialing</a>.  When you press a button on the phone and hear a tone, thats a DTMF tone &ndash; and exactly what this case is about.  Pen registers allow the government to collect telephone metadata.  In a telephonic context, this mean the numbers you dial, your phone number and the length of the call.</p>

          <h3>What is Content?</h3>
          <p>"<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap119-sec2510.htm">[A]ny information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication</a>".  This unequivocally includes any voice transmission on the call.  The courts universally agree that when you dial anything other than a phone number (credit card number, bank pin, etc) it is content.  The courts are less clear on whether or not any phone numbers dialed after a call connects are content or not.</p>
          <p>Content is protected by the Fourth Amendment.  Law enforcement should need a warrant in order to listen to calls.</p>
          <p>Historically, courts have been extremely protective of the content of telephone calls.  In fact, in every federal circuit court, the standard is the same.  Pen registers cannot be used in any context in which they could accidentally gather content.  In practice, this means pen registers can only be used to collect the initial phone number dialed.</p>

          <h3>What is Telephone Metadata?</h3>
          <p>Telephone metadata &ndash; more formally known as DRAS (Dialing, Routing, Addressing and Signaling) information &ndash; describes a type of information which is not protected by the Fourth Amendment.  It is the information a person voluntarily shares with a service provider.  In the context of phone calls, this means the numbers dialed for the initial telephone connection.  The government holds that telephone metadata also includes any additional telephone numbers dialed after the call connects, though this is matter of some debate.  At the most broad, the legal definition of metadata could include everything from internet traffic to faxes to (for the deaf) TTY signals.</p>
          <p>Pen registers also are used in monitoring internet usage and the definition of what constitutes metadata in that context is unexplored.</p>

          <h1>Why is the FISCR 16-01 Ruling Wrong?</h1>

          <p>In FISCR 16-01, the FISA Court of Review went against every other court.  It found that the government is entitled to all the numbers a user dials, even at the expense of potentially collecting content as well.  From a civil liberties perspective, this is exceedingly worrying.  It essentially allows a pen register to be used as a "backdoor warrant" &ndash; it allows the collection of Fourth Amendment protected content without any of the protections required by the Fourth Amendment.  Under FISCR 16-01, a pen register (which, remember, cannot be refused by a judge) can be used to record the entire contents of calls.  While the contents are not admissible in court, they could be used in <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805">parallel construction</a> or other questionably legal methods of acting on inadmissible evidence.</p>

          <p>FISCR 16-01 effectively sidesteps the Fourth Amendment by allowing law enforcement to investigate anyone they wish at any time.  This could be used for everything from harassing dissidents to unmasking whistleblowers to harassing personal enemies.  The use of searches as an extra-judicial punishment is fundamentally the reason the Fourth Amendment exists.  Before the American Revolution, British officials would attempt to silence speech by ordering invasive searches of the homes and places of business of anyone they disagreed with.  The searches were not intended to find anything, but to be extra-judicial punishment.  Our founding fathers, in writing our Bill of Rights, remembered how search could be used as a tool of oppression.  Thus they included a requirement that the government, before intruding into the lives of private citizens, justify any intrusion.</p>

          <p>Further, the Supreme Court has previously held that knowing the government may be listening can have a "chilling effect" on free speech.  More or less, if citizens know the government could listen to them at any time, they will restrict the opinions they express because they fear retaliation for having the “wrong” views.</p>

          <h2>FISCR 16-01 Misunderstands Law</h2>
          <p>FISCR's ruling is based upon a presumption that the government is entitled to any metadata, no matter where it appears.  FISCR used this entitlement to justify allowing the government to collect and store content.  No such entitlement exists.  While there is a possibly-valid argument that the government is allowed any metadata embedded in a call, this argument certainly does not allow the collection of call contents.</p>

          <p>Additionally, FISCR based its ruling on an invalid interpretation of a savings clause.  A savings clause is a portion of a law which says "if you accidentally gather something you shouldn't have, you can't use it in court".  The key word there is accidentally (though the law uses incidentally).  Savings clauses are designed to protect the rights of citizens.  Savings clauses do not convey permission for the government to do anything; in fact they require additional restrictions.  The Supreme Court has previously examined the interpretation of a savings clause as implicitly granting permission and throughly rejected it.</p>

          <p>Both the question of metadata entitlement and the question of savings clauses are legal questions.  Law moves slowly, especially when adapting to new technology.  Under normal circumstances, FISCR being confused by an area in which the law is unclear would be understandable.  However, in this case the ruling is directly in contradiction with every other federal court &ndash; and even the ruling admits as much.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h2>FISCR 16-01 Misunderstands Technology</h2>

          <p>The technological underpinnings of the ruling are stunningly wrong.  The court found that there is no "reasonably available" technology to collect DTMF-as-metadata while discarding DTMF-as-content.  This finding is clearly in error.  CCAD, the Call Contents Automatic Differentiator, was written explicitly for this case, using only technology and algorithms that have been available since the 1980s.  While it is true there is no commercially available technology, this is because there is quite literally no market.  Every other federal court has found &ndash; for years &ndash; that looking at the body of the call for metadata carries too much risk of collecting content and is illegal.</p>

          <p>The court further found that there is no technical difference between dialing a digit that is content and a digit that is metadata.  This is an extremely narrow view, focusing on single digits, rather than groups of digits.  The lack of technical difference was used to justify recording the entire body of the call so that the context might be available to determine what is and is not content at a later time.  Leaving aside the blatantly unconstitutional nature of recording protected content without a warrant, this is still an unnecessary intrusion into the private lives of citizens.  CCAD demonstrates that software is capable of processing the context and determining if digits are content or metadata in better than real time.  Therefore any storage of call contents is unnecessary.</p>

          <h1>How You Can Help</h1>

          <p>While most of this fight is going to occur in the Supreme Court, there are ways you can help.  One of the core tenets of the Fourth Amendment is a "societal willingness" to defend privacy.  The more citizens speak up and make their opinions known, the better the chances the court will take notice of such a societal willingness.  To that end, the best thing you can do is talk about this publicly.  Use social media &ndash; follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thawamerica/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ThawAmerica">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@thawamerica">Medium</a>.</p>

          <p>Additionally, this case exposes how utterly dysfunctional the FISA Courts are.  They don't even rise to the level of kangaroo courts &ndash; the defendant doesn't have a chance to put up the most perfunctory of defenses.  These are not the courts of a free nation, but of an oppressive one.</p>

          <p>Contact your Senators and Representatives.  Let them know you think further reform of FISA is needed.  Tell them FISA needs transparency; that the law must work in the open to work at all.</p>
