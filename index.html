          <p>INSERT NAME is the name of an effort to fight an erroneous decision by a US secret court granting the intelligence community broad new powers to record telephone calls and (potentially) internet traffic.  The case centers on pen registers, a legal tool law enforcement can use to determine who the target of an investigation is in contact with.  Pen registers are legal "must issue" tools - because the information they gather is voluntarily shared with the telephone company it is not private and therefore a pen register is not a search.</p>
          <p>Enter FISCR 16-01.</p>
          <p>FISCR 16-01 is a decision from the extremely secretive FISA Court of Review.  It centers on whether or not investigators may extract any phone numbers embedded in the body of the call.  FISCR, in conflict with every other federal court, found that it was permissible for investigators to record and store the contents of calls in order to extract dialed phone numbers.</p>
          <p>Citizens and legal residents of the United States are guaranteed a right to privacy by the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution.  FISCR's decision violates this right and several other constitutional guarantees.  This website contains documents, articles and other materials related to overturning FISCR 16-01.</p>

          <p>Pen registers are a tool that dates back to the 1970s and the early deployments of DTMF in the telephone system.  A pen register was a small (pen-sized) device which would record numbers dialed on a telephone line.  Wired has a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/10/nsa-smith-purse-snatching/">history of the pen register as applied to mass surveillance</a>.
