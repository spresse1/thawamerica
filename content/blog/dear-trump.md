This letter is written to him.

Dear Mr. Trump,

Today, I watched and listened as you were sworn in as the 45th president of these United States.  As with every swearing in, it is an historic moment.  But to me, one portion of your speech stood out:

> Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another.

> But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.

Mr. Trump, I want to talk to you about mass surveillance.  Power cannot return to the people while the people fear their government's ability to unfairly interfere with their lives.  This is why it is so important - so critical - that you curtail the surveillance state.

The people cannot truly hold power when they're afraid that criticizing their government or speaking up about controversial issues might result in them being investigated or dragged into court over some minor infraction.  The people need to be able to trust that the safeguards of the Constitution are working, that government interference only happens when there is a good reason.

Over the last 15 years, the protections afforded to the ordinary person have been eroded in the name of protecting America.

We cannot protect something by destroying it.

Mr. Trump, I am merely a computer programmer.  I have no particular expertise in law or politics.  But it is obvious, even to me, that our law enforcement agencies are gathering too much power to listen to ordinary Americans who haven't done anything wrong.  They can watch what we do online; they can read our emails and, as of last year, they can record our calls.

Mr. Trump, I am calling on you to restore the basic rights afforded to every American by our Constitution.  I am calling on you to restore law and order, to curtail law enforcement overreaches.  Ensure the government follows its own laws and that our checks and balances function.  Mr. Trump, please ensure the government works for the people, not against them.

Thank you,

Steven Presser
