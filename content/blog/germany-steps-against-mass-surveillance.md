Title: Germany takes steps against Mass Surveillance

On Thursday, a German court [found that the BND must not retain metadata of international calls](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-surveillance/german-court-rules-against-foreign-intelligence-mass-communication-surveillance-idUSKBN1E82RS).  The BND - an equivalent of the USA's NSA - is responsible for collecting foreign intelligence and uses wiretaps and electronic surveillance extensively to do so.

The lawsuit was brought by Reporters Without Borders/Reporters sans Front√®ires (RSF).  This suit is part of a larger effort and focuses on VerAS, a metadata analysis system.  Little independent data appears to be available on VerAS in English.  [According to RSF](https://rsf.org/en/news/reporters-without-borders-germany-sues-german-foreign-intelligence-agency-bnd-over-communications), VerAS (full name: Verkehrsanalysesystem - literally translated as "traffic analysis system") gathers metadata: phone records, SMS message records, email headers, social media data, and other internet traffic for analysis.

Worse, VerAS is allowed to collect metadata on people multiple hops from each suspect.  Let's say I'm a suspect.  If I call you, then you email your best friend, your best friend is now 2 hops from me.

VerAS is allowed to collect metadata up to 4 hops from an original suspect.  4 hops can reach rather far.  For example, if I'm a suspect and:

 - I call you
 - You call your best friend
 - She emails her professor
 - Who calls her wife
 - Who texts her mother

VerAS can now collect metadata about all your professor's wife's mother's emails - even though she probably has no idea you exist, let alone that I exist.

It would appear a significant portion of the German population is likely having their traffic collected and analyzed.  Such multi-hop systems are dangerous, since they easily tar innocent citizens with the guilt of people they've never interacted with.  They make it easy for intelligence agencies to justify digging into the lives of any particular citizen and they massively centralize (and expose to leaks) the information generated by citizens.

RSF's concerns, however, are more concrete.  They frequently work with reporters, whistle-blowers and other vulnerable populations living under authoritarian regimes.  For these populations, being caught communicating with RSF could mean imprisonment or death.  RSF argues that knowing this communication is being spied on interferes with its mission by significantly increasing the risk these communications are exposed.  This in turn creates a chilling effect, where the vulnerable populations are afraid to reach out and their issues may go unheard.

RSF [says](https://rsf.org/en/news/reporters-without-borders-germany-sues-german-foreign-intelligence-agency-bnd-over-communications) that "under these circumstances, the media can no longer fulfill its role as a pillar of control in a democratic society."

Fortunately, a German court has found that VerAS is problematic.  The court ruled the BND may not store metadata on international phone calls.  Unfortunately, we haven't been able to track down a copy of the court's decision and can't comment on the exact findings made by the court.  We'll update this story if we're able to get a copy.

The BND says it will wait for a review of the decision.

This lawsuit is part of a larger set of lawsuits on German mass surveillance.  RSF is currently [appealing other lawsuits to the Eurpean Court of Human Rights](https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-lodges-echr-complaint-over-german-foreign-intelligence-agencys-mass-surveillance-0).
