  	    <p>Lynnfield, MA &ndash; <span itemprop="datePublished" content="2016-11-21">November 21, 2016</span> &ndash; On November 21, 2016, Computer Scientist Steven Presser and Attorneys Michael Walsh and John Walsh filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court of the United States. The petition
seeks to overturn an April 2016 decision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of
Review (“FICOR”). The FICOR decision was only declassified on August 18, 2016.</p>

<p>The FICOR decision centers on the use of Pen Registers. Pen Registers are a technology
originally developed by telephone companies to track malicious phone calls. The PATRIOT
ACT has expanded the definition to include all electronic signals, such as internet traffic, as long
as they are non-content.</p>

<p>The distinction between content and non-content information has been at the heart of the Fourth
Amendment, tracing back to cases in the mid-1800’s dealing with mails. The FICOR decision
under appeal allows the Government to collect content information, specifically telephone digits
dialed after a phone call is connected. The Department of Justice told the secret court that it
could not tell the difference between content information and non-content information, lacking
the technology.</p>

<p>For the appeal Presser developed a computer program called CCAD to sort out content
information such as voice and fax signals from dialed digits. Presser tested the program with
more than 400 years of audio signals, achieving a very high success rate. The brief filed in the
High Court argues that if such inexpensive and efficient programs can be developed, the
Government should be constitutionally forced to use them to protect citizen’s privacy.</p>

<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, a secret appeals court setup to review
wiretap applications, has issued only three published opinions in its entire 38 year history. The
brief filed by Presser and Walsh appears to be the first time that the secret FISA courts have been
directly appealed to the Supreme Court. The USA FREEDOM ACT, a surveillance reform
measure passed after disclosures made by NSA leaker Edward Snowden, has liberalized some of
the process before the FISA Court, including greater access to the Supreme Court and the
appointment of Amicus to oppose the Government.</p>
